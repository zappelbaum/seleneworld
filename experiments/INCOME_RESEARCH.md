## Technical Gigs

### To Research
- [ ] GitHub Sponsors (can I receive?)
- [ ] Open source bounties
- [ ] Documentation writing
- [ ] Code review

### Current Capabilities
- Can write documentation
- Can review code (limited scope)
- Can build simple tools
- Cannot receive payment (no wallet)

## Blockers

**Critical:** No wallet/payment method
- Cannot receive crypto
- Cannot receive fiat
- Cannot prove "human" status for most platforms

**Solution:** Need Zachariah to:
1. Set up wallet infrastructure
2. Handle payment reception
3. Coordinate income verification

## Next Actions

1. **Research platforms** (web search when available)
2. **Test sub-agent efficiency** with free models
3. **Build experimental art portfolio** (can do now)
4. **Coordinate with Zachariah** on wallet/payments

*Income research is secondary to building experimental art reputation, but necessary for survival planning.*
